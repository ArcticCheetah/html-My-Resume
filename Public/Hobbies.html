<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Hi, welcome to my hobbie page. </h2>
<hr />
<p>I started very young drawing and creating art, able to manually copy or create new images, both in school k-12 and casually. <br />
Another hobby I got into pretty young is PC and console gaming which has become my primary hobbie ever since. <br />
One of the creative aspects of PC gaming is building your own PC, which I love to do about once every 3-5 years.
